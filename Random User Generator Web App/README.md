# Random User Generator Web App
This web app uses JS, Node.js, React.js, Express, and HTML. It pulls data from an open source Random User Data Generator API (either directly through the browser or through the server),
and adds it to the web page. It demonstrates understanding of asynchronous programming in JS.
